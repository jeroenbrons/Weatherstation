# features
*either a Red, yellow or green led depending on the temperature (as in bad weather, average weather, or great weather

# WIP features
*display of temperature and other conditions on OLED of the WIFI KIT 8 ESP8266 module

# Known issues

*currently hardcoded to the town of Scherpenzeel, Gelderland, Netherlands (in the HTTP string)
*working on OLED-display version

# ideas
* making the color dependent on rain or not
